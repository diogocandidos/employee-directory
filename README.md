# Employee Directory

## Directions
![License Badge](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=License&message=MIT_License&color=blue)

 create a employee directory with React where the user will be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

 An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
 
  This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## Acceptance Criteria
Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 
The user should be able to:
  * Sort the table by at least one category
  * Filter the users by at least one property.

The data must to display:
picture, first and last name, phone, email, and date of birth.
